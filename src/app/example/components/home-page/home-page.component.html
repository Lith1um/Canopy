    <h2>Angular Template Project</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the angular template project! This started as an idea to create a project designed to make building new apps in angular as easy as possible. It contains the various configuration, boilerplate and functionality that a large number of modern angular websites require to be built in a scalable way. The main plan is to be able to use this repo as a blueprint for future projects, cutting down on the time required to get new Front-End projects off the ground.</p>
    
    <h3>Dependencies</h3>
    <p>A number of open-source libraries are utilised in this app, you can find more on them below:</p>
